# Loading: Principles of Use

## Usage

Loading spinners are used when retrieving data or performing slow computations, and help to notify users that loading is underway.

### How to import

`import { Loading } from '@/component/utility`

### Anatomy

`  <Loading variant={ disabled ? 'white' : buttonFamilyClasses['loadingIcon'][variant] } size='md' />`

### Props

- size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
- variant: 'primary' | 'neutral' | 'white'

### Available Customisations

- variants
- disabled
- sizes

## Accessibility

### Behaviour

The primary accessibility consideration for the loading component is to convey its meaning to assistive technologies so users are aware of changes in status.

### Keyboard interactions

The loading component has no keyboard accessibility considerations since it is intentionally not operable or navigable.
