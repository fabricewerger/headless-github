## Accessibility

### Behaviour

Each tab must have a unique title that clearly describes tab panel content. This is particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have the necessary information to efficiently navigate the content.
Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within each tab panel.
Content authors need to ensure the content that is added to the tab panel is accessible. For example, if you add an image to the panel you need to include alternative text to pass accessibility testing.

### Keyboard interactions

Tabs need to be reached with the TAB button and be activated with ENTER.
