# Breadcrumbs: Principles of Use

## Usage

The breadcrumb is a secondary navigation pattern that helps a user understand the hierarchy among levels and navigate back through them. Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace the primary navigation. They shouldnâ€™t be used for products that have single level navigation because they create unnecessary clutter.

### How to import

`<Breadcrumbs {...args} />`
